We analyzed the dataset and created an ER diagram together.

20.11.2022
I started learning Flask.

22.11.2022
We have uploaded the csv files and the ER diagram. We wrote the code that reads the dataset (parsing.py) and also created the tables (db.sql).

28.11.2022 - 04.12.2022
We studied Flask library and learned frontend.

06.12.2022
We wrote server.py and Flask documents together and created our website (html files and css with bootstrap)

We tried to import our sql file (which has create table and insert into commands) to nfl.db file because we will do add delete and updates with it.
But we had some issues while doing it so we couldn't make big progress today.

15.12.2022
We created alltables_new.sql file which has all dataset in it. We pushed this sql and group2_nfl.db to repository. With SQLite extension in VsCode, group2_nfl.db can be seen as tables.
I wrote my html file to see my table (defensive) and I limited it with 30 rows in website.
I wrote add_defensive_stat() and get_all_defensive_stats() functions.
Me and Pelin wrote delete function in views.py and database.py for kickoff table and make it a link button in html so when it is clicked related row is deleted. And it is permanent.
I make researches about add and update functions and analyze week6 recitation to implement it to our project.
