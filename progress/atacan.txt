15.11.2022: I started to learn flask for python.

17.11.2022: We got together with the group and restructured the data such as eliminating extra 
tables and columns that has too much Null values. Also we constructed the E/R diagram of the dataset.

22.11.2022: We started to push and commit to github. Also we wrote the SQL table creation codes for all of the tables. 
Also I wrote the python code for parsing the csv files and generated the SQL statement for Insert functions.

28.11.2022 - 05.12.2022: As a group, we studied the movie example project from flask application development page of Mr. Uyar to learn 
how to implement the necesarry parts of the database server and functionalities.

14.11.2022: I implemented receiving table's get_all function in order to view all the data as a table however I didn't push the 
changes into neither test or main db2022 repository because of some errors and bugs in the program.

15.11.2022: We met as a group. As a group we converted the csv files into the SQL Insert queries then we created our database called group2_nfl.db. 
Then all of the group members implemented  get_all functions and changed their page's HTML files in order to view all the data as a table 
and everyone pushed it into the test depository.  Also as a group we cleaned the unnecesarry files from the test repository 
(where all of our codes and pages were working as intented in that time). After that as a cleaner project we pushed all of the files from 
test repository to the main db2022 repository. After the meeting I also implemented my page's delete function, modified my page's HTML file 
accordingly and pushed it into the main db2022 repository.

16.11.2022: We met as a group. We implemented view, add and delete function for the shared table (basic_stats) and pushed it in to the repository. Also
update and add function for my table (receiving) is implemented and pushed to the repository.

17.11.2022: Update function for the shared table (basic_stats) is implement and pushed in to the repository. Also css and html files for the view pages are changed
for to look aesthetic.

18.11.2022: Css and html file for atacan_edit.html is changed and pushed to the repository. Radio buttons and selection box is added while text boxes and save button is reworked.
